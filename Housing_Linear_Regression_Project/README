🏠 House Price Prediction using Multivariate Linear Regression
Project Overview

This project implements a multivariate linear regression model using Python to predict house prices based on multiple features.

The model uses three independent variables to predict a single dependent variable, making it a practical example of real-world regression modeling in real estate analysis.

Dataset Description

The dataset contains four columns:

area – size of the house (independent variable)

bedrooms – number of bedrooms (independent variable)

age – age of the property in years (independent variable)

price – house price (dependent variable)

The house price is assumed to depend on the area, number of bedrooms, and the age of the property.

Libraries Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Data Loading and Exploration

The dataset was loaded using Pandas.

The structure of the data was inspected to understand the columns and data types.

Missing values were identified during initial exploration.

Handling Missing Values

The bedrooms column contained missing values.

Since the data is numeric and ordered, the median was used to fill missing values.

After imputation, the dataset contained no missing values, making it suitable for modeling.

Feature and Target Separation
Independent Variables (X)

Area

Bedrooms

Age

Dependent Variable (y)

Price

The dependent variable was explicitly named for clarity and readability in the modeling process.

Model Training

A Linear Regression model was built using Scikit-learn.

The model was trained using the independent variables and the target variable.

After training, the following were examined:

Model coefficients

Model intercept

Model performance score

Model Evaluation

The model achieved a score of approximately 0.9555.

This high score indicates a strong relationship between the independent variables and the house price.

The result suggests that the model fits the data well and produces reliable predictions.

Predictions

The trained model was used to predict house prices for different combinations of:

Area

Number of bedrooms

Age of the house

Predicted prices were rounded to two decimal places for better readability and presentation.

Key Learnings

Multivariate linear regression can effectively model real estate pricing.

Handling missing values before training is critical.

Model coefficients help explain how each feature affects the target variable.

High model scores indicate good predictive performance when data quality is strong.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates:

End-to-end regression modeling

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Feature-target separation

Model training, evaluation, and prediction

It serves as a solid foundation for more advanced machine learning models and real-world pricing systems.
